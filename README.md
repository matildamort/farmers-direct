## Purpose 
Coles and Woolworths attempt to complete with the low prices of Aldi has seen both businesses focus heavily of 'low prices'. Rather than reduce running costs or reducing operating costs through simplified operating such as Aldi's model, these businesses have used thier buying power and ‘negotiate’ price reductions. This fundamentally undercuts our farmers. 

This application seeks to allow farmers to set thier own pricing model on thier goods and sell directly to thier customers. Customers can choose which farmers they wish to puchase from, customers can purchase from multiple farmers within thier local and have one simple delivery of thier purcase. 

Once a customer has checked out, the order is placed with a farmer, who will drop off the goods at a centralised local warehouse for processing, quality control and shippment. 

Farm Direct's model will be to take a percentage of all sales, to cover operating costs, delivery and a small profit margin. Although this still has a middle man the overall profit margin for farmers and small businesses is still significantly increased. 





## Why this app?
There are currently a few apps on the market that have 'similar' concepts; however this is still a niche market and the business models currently seen as different in that they either operate as one business, one face, one brand and do not promote the farmers directly or they have not integrated e-commerce and simply show the end user where the local farmers are and the customer has little option to purchase without contacting each farmer individually. 

I believe our farmers should recieve greater recognition and in turn profits for thier hard work and not be undervalued. In addition, we have a huge amount of food waste as the 'standard' of produce aesthetics is driven by our duopoly couple, coles and woolworths. This app provides an opportunity for farmers to sell these products directly without reducing the price or contributing to food waste unnessecarily.

## Third party services

### Ruby Gems
This application uses a series of ruby gems that support the functionality of the application, apart from the ones that come as a standard with the Rails framework.

gem 'devise' - Handlesalmost completely the user processing. 
gem 'bootstrap' - Handles all styling
gem 'jquery-rails' - Javascript transpiler to convert JS 
gem 'stripe' - Supports payment gateway
gem 'simple_form' - Supports creation of forms and conencts specifically with devise which uses simple form as a standard. 
gem 'aws-sdk-s3' - Supports the integration of imagery form AWS S3
gem 'image_processing' - Manipulate images
gem 'dotenv-rails' - automatically loads environment variables from a . env file into the process.For this app the STRIPE public and secret keys are stored in and env file. 
gem 'ranker'
gem "mini_magick" - Manipulate images, different functions to image_processing


### Third party Applications
AWS S3 - This is a cloud storage for image uploads. When an image is uploaded by a user it is saved automatically to S3 cloud and displayed on the front end. 
Stripe - This is a payment processing platform and handled user purchases, completely, with very little implemenation required. this can be cusomised, but at present is in basic format. 

### Installations required (Terminal Commands)
npm i bootstrap-icons 
rails g devise:install
rails active_storage:install

## Relationship model
Describe your projects models in terms of the relationships (active record associations) they have with each other

My Relationship model had a few small changes on what was achievable, Some items in this did not get implemetned but are planned for future dev, I have left these in there and colour coded them red to indicate not yet complete. There are some discrepencies I believe between this model and the final outcome. For example, the model suggest that a farmer will own a product, which is 'somewhat' the case, however it is actually a user who owns the product and a user is also a farmer. 

I believe my relationshop diagram acurately describes the relationships and these are implemented accurately in my models. e.g  Ashopping cart has_many :products, through: :line_items or an Order belongs_to :user (Although I havn't got a view to set up to show this yet).

## Database relations
Discuss the database relations to be implemented in your application

## Database design

I think my schema is relitively the same as my ERD, omitting items not yet developed. Also, my 'origional' ERD did not have a shopping cart, which would not have worked, however this has been updated. Also some features still need views functionality such as product description, at present it is not being called from the DB to view.

## Project Management and Prioritising
R20	Describe the way tasks are allocated and tracked in your project - Use Trello, relationship between tasks and user story's - Add user stories to Trello. 

TRELLO
https://trello.com/b/MtCNmHtP/farmers-marketplace 

The main features of the application were implemented as a priority starting with guest user story, to farmer user story. Items that were identified as to large for remaining timeframe were listed as out of time scope or for future dev. 

What I realised however as I went is that the user stories should have been much larger and more detailed. E.g a user can add items to thier cart - which will take them to thier cart; however there was nothing to say, user can access thier cart so many features needed to be added for better UX that were not origiionally in the plan. 

Once the app had the features required, styling was implemented as a basic and only towards the end was full styling given higher priority.
