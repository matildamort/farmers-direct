## Purpose 
Coles and Woolworths attempt to complete with the low prices of Aldi has seen both businesses focus heavily of 'low prices'. Rather than reduce running costs or reducing operating costs through simplified operating such as Aldi's model, these businesses have used thier buying power and ‘negotiate’ price reductions. This fundamentally undercuts our farmers. 

This application seeks to allow farmers to set thier own pricing model on thier goods and sell directly to thier customers. Customers can choose which farmers they wish to puchase from, customers can purchase from multiple farmers within thier local and have one simple delivery of thier purcase. 

Once a customer has checked out, the order is placed with a farmer, who will drop off the goods at a centralised local warehouse for processing, quality control and shippment. 

Farm Direct's model will be to take a percentage of all sales, to cover operating costs, delivery and a small profit margin. Although this still has a middle man the overall profit margin for farmers and small businesses is still significantly increased. 



## Why this app?
There are currently a few apps on the market that have 'similar' concepts; however this is still a niche market and the business models currently seen as different in that they either operate as one business, one face, one brand and do not promote the farmers directly or they have not integrated e-commerce and simply show the end user where the local farmers are and the customer has little option to purchase without contacting each farmer individually. 

I believe our farmers should recieve greater recognition and in turn profits for thier hard work and not be undervalued. In addition, we have a huge amount of food waste as the 'standard' of produce aesthetics is driven by our duopoly couple, coles and woolworths. This app provides an opportunity for farmers to sell these products directly without reducing the price or contributing to food waste unnessecarily.
